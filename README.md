# Django-Framework-Website
This is a hobby project to build a full-stack website using the Django framework. The concept of the website is to create a hub for users to post their creative ideas. The website aims to provide a platform for creative individuals to showcase their ideas and connect with like-minded people.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the development of the website:

1. Django - Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It encourages beautiful code and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

2. Python - Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.

3. HTML, CSS and JavaScript - HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for the front-end development of the website. HTML provides the structure, CSS provides the styling, and JavaScript provides the interactivity.

4. Bootstrap - Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides a responsive grid system, pre-designed UI components, and other CSS and JavaScript-based design templates.

5. SQLite - SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is used as the database for the website.
